## Agenda

- Create GitHub account and repository
- Create Kaggle account
- Get ChatGPT EDU access
- Install Positron IDE
- Install Python and R
- Test your language installations



# GitHub {.center}

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is the industry standard for cloud-based version control, file backup, and portfolio hosting. It allows you to:

- Track changes to your code over time (and revert if needed)
- Showcase your projects to potential employers
- Collaborate with others (for the next capstone)

GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux).

## Basic GitHub Structure

- **Repository** (AKA "repo"): A master project folder containing all files/folders and history for a project
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository
- **README**: A markdown file (.md) that describes the project (or portions of it)

Many deliverables in this course will be README files hosted in your project repo.

## Set Up GitHub Account

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Use your university email address so you will be eligible later for a free GitHub Pro account (if you want)
4. Choose a professional username (visible to employers)
5. Verify your email address

Next week we will link Positron and Github. This will allow you to work locally in Positron and "push" changes to GitHub.

## Create GitHub Repo

1. After logging in, click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
2. Select "New repository"
3. Name the repository: e.g, `home-credit-project`
4. Add a description if you want (you will add to this over time)
5. Choose "Public" visibility
6. Add a README file
7. No .gitignore for now
8. No license for now
9. Click "Create repository"


Later you will create folders within this main project repo. Each folder will have a README describing its contents.


# Kaggle {.center}

## Set Up Kaggle Account

Kaggle hosts the Home Credit competition dataset and provides a platform to test your model performance against a hold out set.

1. Go to [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. Sign up with your email
3. Complete your profile
4. Navigate to [Home Credit Default Risk Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk)
5. Accept the competition rules

Note: Do not download the datasets yet

# ChatGPT {.center}

## ChatGPT EDU Access

You have free access to ChatGPT through the University of Utah. We will use it for research and document drafting.

- Read [ChatGPT EDU Getting Started](https://ai.utah.edu/tools/chatgpt/get-started.php)
- Follow the university's authentication process
- Verify you can access you ChatGPT EDU account

# Positron IDE {.center}

## Why Positron?

Positron is Posit's successor to RStudio, designed for AI-assisted data science workflows. It is fork of VS Code.

- Integrates AI tools for coding assistance
- Supports both R and Python through Quarto notebooks
- Seamlessly works with GitHub for version control
- Purpose built for data science (occupies a unique niche)

## Positron Installation - macOS

1. Go to [positron.posit.co/install.html](https://positron.posit.co/install.html)
2. Download the latest version for macOS
3. Open the `.dmg` file and drag Positron to Applications
4. Launch Positron from Applications

## Positron Installation - Windows

1. Go to [positron.posit.co/install.html](https://positron.posit.co/install.html)
2. Download the latest version for Windows
3. Run the installer `.exe` file
4. Follow the installation wizard
5. Launch Positron from the Start menu

## Positron AI

Positron has two main AI tools:

- **Databot**: EDA partner for rapid data exploration
- **Positron Assistant**: coding partner for other data science tasks (in ask, agent, edit and plan modes)

These tools depend on large language models (LLMs) hosted by third-party providers. You need to specify which LLM you want to use.

## Language Model Options

- GitHub Copilot (free)
- Anthropic Claude (paid, possibly best performance). Cost estimate: $20 for the project with Sonnet 4.5.
- Cline (free or paid options). This is a VS Code extension (all of which work in Positron).

[Setup Guide](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html)

Advice: Start with GitHub Copilot and change later if needed. We will demo the setup in class next week.

## Copilot Access

- Sign in to GitHub
- In another tab search for (or open) the Copilot plans page: [https://github.com/features/copilot/plans](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans)
- Choose the Free option.  Click "Get Started." 
- Authorize Copilot for your GitHub account

Even better:  As a student, you can get Copilot Pro for free.  See [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for details.

# Python and R Setup {.center}

## Python Setup

1. Go to [docs.python.org/3/using/index.html](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html)
2. Download Python 3.10 or higher for your operating system
3. Run the installer
   - **Windows**: Check "Add Python to PATH"
   - **macOS**: Use the `.pkg` installer

## R Setup

1. Go to [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Click "Download R"
3. Select a CRAN mirror (any US mirror works)
4. Download R for your operating system
5. Run the installer

## Test Your Setup - Python

Create a new file in Positron and run:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
import sys
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"Pandas version: {pd.__version__}")
print(f"NumPy version: {np.__version__}")
print("✓ Python setup successful!")
```

## Test Your Setup - R

Create a new file in Positron and run:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| 
library(tidyverse)

cat("R version:", R.version.string, "\n")
cat("Tidyverse loaded successfully\n")
cat("✓ R setup successful!\n")
```
