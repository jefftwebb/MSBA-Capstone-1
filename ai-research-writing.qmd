# When AI Helps

---

## AI is good at

| Task | Example |
|------|---------|
| Outlines | "What sections should a problem statement include?" |
| Explanations | "What does loss given default mean?" |
| Search terms | "What should I search for credit risk research?" |
| Drafting from notes | Writing after you give it your research |
| Revision | "Make this shorter" or "Add detail here" |

---

## AI is bad at

| Task | Problem |
|------|---------|
| Current statistics | Training data is old |
| Citations | Makes up sources that don't exist |
| Recent events | Doesn't know what happened last month |
| Niche facts | Confident but often wrong |

**Use AI for structure. Verify facts yourself.**

---

# Staged Research

---

## The problem with one prompt

Ask AI to "write a business problem statement for Home Credit" and you get:

- Guessed statistics
- Made-up sources
- Missing regulatory context
- Generic content

It looks professional. It may be wrong.

---

## Build context first

| Stage | Document | Time |
|-------|----------|------|
| 1 | Domain research (industry facts) | 20-30 min |
| 2 | Company research (Home Credit) | 15-20 min |
| 3 | Genre research (what a problem statement looks like) | 10-15 min |
| 4 | Verify all statistics | 15-20 min |
| 5 | Draft with all context attached | 20-30 min |

Total: ~90 minutes

---

# Building Research Documents

---

## Two laws you need to know

| Law | Full name | Requirement |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| ECOA | Equal Credit Opportunity Act | Give specific reasons when denying credit |
| FCRA | Fair Credit Reporting Act | Tell people what factors hurt their score |

Your model must be explainable. "The algorithm said no" is not legal.

---

## The CFPB's position

> "Companies are not absolved of their legal responsibilities when they let a black-box model make lending decisions."
> — CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, 2022

You must be able to explain why someone was denied.

---

## Domain research: what to find

Record statistics in a table you can verify:

| Statistic | Value | Source | Verified |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Credit invisible (2020) | 7 million (2.7%) | CFPB Technical Correction 2025 | Yes |
| Unscorable (2020) | 25.3 million (9.8%) | CFPB Technical Correction 2025 | Yes |
| Delinquency rate (Q3 2024) | 3.5% | NY Fed Household Debt Report | Yes |

---

## Watch out: the CFPB correction

| Report | Credit invisible estimate | Status |
|--------|---------------------------|--------|
| 2015 original | 26 million (11%) | Wrong — data error |
| 2025 correction | 7 million (2.7%) | Correct |

The old number is everywhere online. AI will cite it. Use the corrected number.

---

## Company research: Home Credit facts

| Item | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| Founded | 1997 | Company website |
| Customers served | 144+ million (cumulative) | LinkedIn 2024 |
| Target customers | People with little/no credit history | Company mission |
| Countries | 9 (as of 2024) | Company website |
| Approach | Uses phone and transaction data for credit decisions | Kaggle competition |

---

## Genre research: problem statement structure

Ask AI what sections a problem statement should have:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Business context | Company, market, why this matters |
| Problem definition | What decision needs to be made |
| Success criteria | How you'll measure success |
| Constraints | Regulatory limits, data limits |
| Scope | What's included and excluded |

Aim for 1-2 pages.

---

## Style guide

Already in your repo: `docs/style_guide.md`

- Audience: Faculty and future employers
- Tone: Professional, not stiff
- Format: Paragraphs for analysis, bullets only for lists
- Length: 1-2 pages for problem statement

Attach this file when asking AI to draft.

---

# Verifying AI Output

---

## Verification checklist

For every statistic you plan to use:

1. Click the URL — does the page exist?
2. Find the number — is it actually there?
3. Check the date — is this the most recent version?
4. Read the context — any corrections or caveats?
5. Cross-reference — do other sources agree?

If you can't verify it, don't use it.

---

## Warning signs

| Sign | Example | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| Specific number, no source | "Default rate is 7.3%" | Ask for source |
| Citation doesn't exist | Paper not found in search | Don't use |
| Too convenient | Exactly answers your question | Verify independently |
| Round numbers | "About 50%" | Find the real figure |

---

## Better prompts for research

Weak:

```
What are typical default rates for consumer loans?
```

Better:

```
Search for consumer loan delinquency rates from the 
Federal Reserve or CFPB. 

Cite specific sources with URLs. I will verify these.
```

"I will verify" changes how AI responds.

---

# Writing the Problem Statement

---

## Business framing vs technical framing

| Technical | Business |
|-----------|----------|
| Improve AUC from 0.75 to 0.80 | Reduce losses by $X million |
| Handle 8% positive class | Account for rare but costly defaults |
| Feature engineering | Use alternative data to reach underserved customers |
| Model interpretability | Provide required denial reasons |

Lead with business value. Support with technical approach.

---

## Final drafting prompt

```
Write the business problem statement for Home Credit.

ATTACHED:
- Domain research (verified statistics)
- Company research (Home Credit facts)  
- Style guide (formatting)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use only statistics I marked as verified
- Mention ECOA requirement for denial explanations
- Lead with business value
- 1-2 pages
- Follow style guide
```

---

## Update your project context

After drafting, add to `positron.md`:

```markdown
## Business Problem Summary
Home Credit serves customers with limited credit history. 
Goal: predict default while providing explainable decisions.

## Key Constraints
- Must provide denial reasons (ECOA)
- ~32M Americans lack traditional credit scores
- About 8% of loans default

## Current Phase
- [x] Problem statement
- [ ] EDA
```

# Assignment

## This week's deliverable

Create `docs/problem_statement.md`

| Phase | Tasks | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| Research | Domain + company docs with sources | 35-50 min |
| Verify | Click every link, confirm every number | 15-20 min |
| Draft | Attach context, follow style guide | 20-30 min |
| Commit | Push to GitHub | 5 min |

---

## Before you submit

- All statistics have sources with URLs
- ECOA mentioned (model must be explainable)
- Business value stated
- 1-2 pages
- Follows `docs/style_guide.md`
- `positron.md` updated
- Committed to `docs/` folder

---

## Summary

1. AI helps with structure — outlines, explanations, drafts
2. AI fails with facts — verify everything yourself
3. Build context first — research before drafting
4. Record your sources — table with URLs
5. Know the regulations — ECOA requires explainable decisions
6. Frame for business — value first, technique second
