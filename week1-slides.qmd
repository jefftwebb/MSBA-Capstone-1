## Course Details

**Course**: Graduate Business Analytics Capstone  
**Credits**: 1.5 credits, 15 weeks (excluding spring break)  
**Project**: [Home Credit Default Risk Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk)

---

## Overview of MSBA Capstone

- Capstone is a two-course, 3 credit sequence that bridges classroom learning to real-world data analytics. 
    - Capstone 1 (1.5 credits) features an end-to-end **practice  project** from problem framing through model deployment and presentation.
    - Capstone 2 (1.5 credits) features a **sponsored case competition** with real clients.

**The practice project this semester will prepare you for the sponsored case competition next semester**, which will include many of the same assignments.

---

## Key Features of Capstone 1

- Real, messy data (10 interconnected files, missing values, class imbalance)
- Emphasis on business decisions, not just model accuracy
- Modern AI tools used the way practitioners use them in industry
- GitHub portfolio tells your story to future employers, demonstrating your ability to deliver business value through data science.

---

## The Home Credit Project

- Home Credit provides consumer loans to people with little or no traditional credit history and no credit scores.

- Your task is not simply to predict default (the Kaggle competition objective), but to **optimize profit given the business model of increasing access**.

- This reframes the problem from prediction accuracy to *business decision-making under uncertainty*.

## Core Technologies {.smaller}

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Python or R** | Data analysis and modeling (your choice) |
| **GitHub** | Version control and portfolio hosting |
| **Positron IDE** | AI-assisted coding with Databot and Assistant |
| **Quarto** | Reproducible reporting |
| **Terminal** | Command-line execution for GitHub operations |

---

## GitHub 

You'll use GitHub to:

- Store reproducible scripts and functions (not data or models)
- Maintain a professional README that tells your project story
- Deploy your decision support app via GitHub Pages
- Create a portfolio piece that demonstrates your full workflow

Think of your repository as your resume for this project.

---

## Positron 

- Posit's successor to RStudio, designed for AI-assisted data science workflows.

- Uniquely able to support interchangeable use of R and Python via Quarto notebooks.

- Includes **Databot** for exploration and **Positron Assistant** for production code.

## AI in This Course

- There are a lot of assignments in this course! AI will help you complete them.

- **The course deliverables cannot be completed in this 15-week timeframe without AI assistance.**

---

## AI Philosophy

AI coding assistants are tools, not authors. You make the decisions—AI helps you execute faster.

---

## Your Job vs. AI's Job {.smaller}

| Your Job | AI's Job |
|----------|----------|
| Understand the business problem | Write boilerplate code quickly |
| Decide what analysis to run | Execute repetitive tasks |
| Interpret results critically | Suggest approaches you might not know |
| Catch errors and validate output | Generate first drafts for iteration |
| Own the final deliverable | Help you get unstuck |

---

## Critical Rule

**Don't submit AI output you don't understand.**

If you can't explain why your code works, you're not ready to submit it.

---

## AI Tools 

**Databot** — Your EDA partner. 

- Purpose-built for rapid exploration. 
- Works in a WEAR loop (Write → Execute → Analyze → Regroup), proposing next steps after each analysis. 
- Use for Week 5 EDA. 
- Not designed for production code.

---

## AI Tools 

**Positron Assistant** — Your coding partner. 

- Writes persistent, versioned code to disk. 
- Four modes: Ask, Edit, Agent, Plan. 
- Use for Weeks 6+ when building reproducible pipelines.

---

## AI Tools 

**ChatGPT** — Your research and writing partner. 

- You have free access through your EDU account. 
- Use for domain research, document drafting, and brainstorming.

---

## Meeting Format

**Today (Week 1)**: In-person, CRCC 205

**Weeks 2-13**: Zoom meetings

**Weeks 14-16**: In-person presentations

See the weekly schedule in the syllabus for details.

## Assignment

**Due: Sunday, January 11**

- Review the [Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk) pages.

- **Important**: Do NOT download the datasets yet. We'll set up your environment properly in Week 2.

---

## Looking Ahead to Week 2

Plan for **~1-2 hours** to set up your technical environment:

- Create accounts (GitHub, Kaggle, ChatGPT EDU)
- Install software (Positron, Python, R)
- Configure Positron Assistant
